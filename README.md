# Inconsistent 500 Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Express.js applications: inconsistent 500 Internal Server Errors caused by unhandled asynchronous errors within route handlers.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js app with a route handler that simulates an asynchronous operation.  Sometimes this operation succeeds, and the server responds with 'Hello from Express!'. Other times, it simulates a failure (e.g., a database error), resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error. The inconsistency makes debugging difficult because the error isn't consistently reproducible.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution by properly handling potential errors using `try...catch` blocks within the asynchronous operation or by using async/await and error handling within the async function.  This ensures that even if an error occurs, the server responds gracefully and consistently, preventing unexpected 500 errors.
